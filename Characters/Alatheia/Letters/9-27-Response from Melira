Lovely Alatheia,
What a joy to hear from you. Things are going quite well here, though surely not nearly as exciting as whatever you are finding in the wider world.
We've had several new members join in the past couple of months, which is nice. It has felt empty around here since you and Sabeth left.

We are feeling some new tensions growing in the region, as it seems the lusting gaze of Risveld has begun to wander westward.
Of course, the local townships here still serve City Rosegate, but more and more of the Risveldian troops have been seen throughout the countryside, and whispers of war have begun.
It is uncomfortable to be sure, but we still do our duties, serving who we can regardless of origin or banner.

Toroden has been back at the temple recently and he sends his well wishes. Take care of yourself dear. May Sune's grace shine upon you.
