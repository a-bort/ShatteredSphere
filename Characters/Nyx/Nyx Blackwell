Nyx is a Tiefling

Father:

Detailed Brainstorming Discussion

Father is not very loving (Tiefling)
-- Recognizes that her place is not in Esteria, better to carry
on mom's legacy
Mother was loving though (Wood Elf)

Her mother taught her basic shadow monk stuff
- Told her bits and pieces about her background

If they were to go back through Esteria, she wouldn't be
opposed to seeing her father if she can get something from him.

Probably didn't expect to see each other again. Not a loving reunion

Father/family is the Rice Wine family
- Outlander, Far traveler, Noble, Inheritor

Level 1 - when mom was teaching her stuff.
Tropean Wastes - 1-3
-- Super lonely
-- Doing odd jobs/outsider for the different tribes
--- Fighting and spying and make a name for
-- Growing stronger
Levels 4-6
-- Honing skills at a monastery...?
-- Researching stuff. Getting info on this map.
-- Monastery has a library.

Question: thinking through what you've learned about the map in that time.
