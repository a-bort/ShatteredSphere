Nyx is a Tiefling

Father:

Detailed Brainstorming Discussion

Father is not very loving (Tiefling)
-- Recognizes that her place is not in Esteria, better to carry
on mom's legacy
Mother was loving though (Wood Elf)

Elena - Human Shadow Monk

Her mother taught her basic shadow monk stuff
- Told her bits and pieces about her background

Had a tutor named Malikar (Tiefling)

If they were to go back through Esteria, she wouldn't be
opposed to seeing her father if she can get something from him.

Probably didn't expect to see each other again. Not a loving reunion

Father/family is the Rice Wine family
- Outlander, Far traveler, Noble, Inheritor

Level 1 - when mom was teaching her stuff.
Tropean Wastes - 1-3
-- Super lonely
-- Doing odd jobs/outsider for the different tribes
--- Fighting and spying and make a name for
-- Growing stronger
Levels 4-6
-- Honing skills at a monastery...?
-- Researching stuff. Getting info on this map.
-- Monastery has a library.

Question: thinking through what you've learned about the map in that time.

Shadowmark Tatoo (attunement)
Taking advantage of the tattoo's Shadow form ability requires you to attune to the tattoo. Ending this attunement does not remove the tattoo.

Shadow Form
The tattoo has 1 charge, which recharges daily at dawn. As a bonus action you can expend one of the tattoo's charges to become incorporeal until the end of your next turn. For the duration you gain the following benefits:
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from non-magical attacks.
* You can't be grappled or restrained.
* You can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn in a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage. If the effect ends while you are inside a solid object, you instead are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, and you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.

The tattoo gains more charges as you uncover more of the secrets that it holds.
