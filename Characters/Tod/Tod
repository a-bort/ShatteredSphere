tod lived in one of these subsistence farming/fishing villages, fairly small and close knit. proximity to the salt flats meant we rarely left the village and were definitely raised to fear the outside and mostly shunned magic

tod, being fairly strong, served as the handyman/helper whenever needed, maybe building stuff for the farmers and fishermen? something like that i’m not totally sure. probably also a big part of harvesting

i had an idea that we could flesh out: when he was young, tod went out past the limits set by the village elders and found *something* in the salt flats/forest that connected him to the feywild. he was terrified of this and had no idea what it was. the elders were super mad at him and he had to keep it a secret his whole life. when the berserkers attacked the village and killed his wife, one of the remaining elders told everyone that tods childhood brush with creepy fey is what brought them, prompting his exit from home. it was an incredibly large, bone white tree. He was captivated by it, and drawn to it, and could feel what he probably now assumes were "dark spirits" reach out and touch him.

i think the elder would be a semi rival, or at least someone he kinda fears? he has some drinking buddies back there, particularly talia, his sister in law who always had his back. she’s a fisherwoman, tod built her boat

Has a Firbolg friend named Lief who lives in Ballybrook.

when the fey turtles show up tod will not immediately link them to the fey magic that powers his spells, because he’s still a bit scared of his magic (which he thinks is completely separate from other magic users) and thinks the swarm is like his god forgiving him?
