just kinda checking in, mentioning how my fey turtles are aiding me in combat and such now. Yeah, I think he's the one that knows anything about the Feywild, and so I'm more just curious about what he might know about my newfound magic. I'm also asking if he's heard of these weird wild magical effects in certain areas, kinda seeing how widespread this effect is. Otherwise i'd probably give him a lil summary  of all my new companions, making special note of Alathea's god Sune (since he knows stuff about gods), Lenny's weird robot, and Flicker's color changing stuff... just keeping my  bud informed about my life, and about all the new weird magic i've been seeing.
