Leif’s Letter

Things in Ballybrook are good. Sounds like your powers are getting stronger - perhaps a stronger connection to the Feywild. From recent research sounds like there may have been many connections before, but now they are few and far between. Rumored that one exists in the petrified wood to the east, and I suspect that great white tree you encountered in the Greenmire another may have been another. That’s probably where the connection came from.

Magic is known to be unstable, and some areas have different additional effects. I can’t explain it, but it’s definitely real.
