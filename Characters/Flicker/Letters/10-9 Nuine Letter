Hey Flicker,

It's been a while! Hope everything is good up north.
I'm just passing through a this raucous little town called Chesfield.
I mean, I heard the Western Alliance has some bandit problems, and now I see where they all must come from!
These gangs practically run the place.
I'm just trying to keep a low profile and get out of here as soon as possible.
(It's a miracle the Black Pearl manages to keep a branch open among all this craziness. I suppose they must pay some pretty serious protection money.)

Anywho, I hope you got my last letter. If you didn't:
[SUMMARY OF THE LAST LETTER]

So anyway, I've made it to this bandit nest of Chesfield, and when I checked a map I realized that your little frontier town of Ironside is not that far away at all!
How are things going out there?
Has the excitement kept up, or have you settled into a more laid back line of work?
If I had to guess.... I'd say you're probably racking up stories that'd make the masters fall out of their chairs!
Experience is the best teacher, Ketara always says.
And based on what I've heard from you so far, I'm inclined to agree!

Seriously, hope all is well.
Write me in Esteria if you can.
Not sure what's left of civilization beyond that, but I'm going to find out.
I've heard a few interesting stories and am ready to create some of my own!

Keep burning bright, little ember!
Nuine
