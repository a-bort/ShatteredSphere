Hey Flicker!

I'm glad to hear that you're safe and sound. To be honest, some of us were a little worried when you headed off on your own, but I knew you'd find your way... though, I mean, zombies and caves, that sounds pretty hardcore! Your friends sound great though, so I'm sure together you're handling it, no problem!
We miss you here, the masters are still a little flummoxed about you. The place doesn't have the same energy without you, that's for sure. Hearing from you, it makes me excited to finish my training, and to get out into the wide world. You're actually quite an inspiration right now. Thank you for writing even though it's not an emergency, and stop by some time!! We'd all love to see you.
Stay safe, BIG HEARTS.

Nuine (not nunu dammit!)
