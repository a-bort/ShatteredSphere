Flicker!

Let me get this straight. You fought, an EYE MONSTER? LIKE, A BEHOLDER?? Noooo wayy.
I think master Ketara would LOVE to pick your brain on that one!

Actually, I have been working a LOT with master Ketara to figure out my pilgrimage of elemental mastery, and we've come up with a pretty wild idea.
You know how so many people are scared to tap into the weave of magic because it's unstable?
And we are taught to exercise our elemental powers only in situations of dire need?
There are stories of people who go into the Tropean Wastes and return with additional control over that chaos.
Ketara has been researching this and she thinks that there's something to these stories!
So I am planning to make my pilgrimage out there, to the heart of the wastes.
Typically pilgrimages are made alone... but Ketara says they can make an exception for this one, since it's pretty much unexplored territory for the temple.
No other monks though - this has to be my journey.
My plan was to head east along the trade routes to Esteria and try to put together a team along the way.
Since you're over in that direction now... maybe we could meet up?!
I think Chesfield isn't too far from Ironside. Or if you have plans to go south, Goldencross is supposed to be pretty nice.
I am planning to leave in about two weeks (today is the 21st) and should be in Chesfield in about four weeks time.
Write to me at the Black Pearl in Redvale (or Goldencross... or Chesfield if you don't get this for a while).

All the best,
Nuine
