Flicker!

EYE MONSTER? LIKE, A BEHOLDER?? Noooo wayy.
I think master Ketara would LOVE to pick your brain about that one!

Actually, I have been working a LOT with master Ketara to figure out my pilgrimage of elemental mastery.
We've come up with a pretty... far out idea.
You know how many people are scared to tap into the weave of magic because it's unstable?
And we are taught to exercise our powers only in situations of dire need?
There are stories of people who go into the Tropean Wastes and return with additional control over that chaos.
Ketara has been researching this and she thinks that there's something to these stories!
So I am planning to make my pilgrimage out there, to try to figure out what that's all about.
Usually pilgrimages are taken alone... but Ketara is willing to make an exception for this one, since it's pretty much unexplored territory.
But no other monks - I have to lead this journey.
My plan was to make my way along the trading routes to Esteria and try to put together a team along the way.
Since you're over in that direction now, maybe we could meet up!
I think Chesfield isn't too far from Ironside. Or if you have plans to go south, Goldencross is supposed to be really nice.
And you know, if you wanted to, I mean, I don't want to impose or anything....
but maybe, if you were interested, I mean, maybe you and your friends could come with me? If you were up for it.
The wastes are supposed to be pretty rough and crazy, but it sounds like you guys are really strong!
I doubt it'd be much danger for you guys. And I'd feel a lot better if I knew I could trust the folks on my team.
Of course, that's just a crazy idea I had, I know you have a lot going on so nothing to worry about.
But I hope we can at least say hi! I am actually planning to leave in about a week and should be in Chesfield in about three weeks time.
Write to me at the Black Pearl in Redvale (or Goldencross or Chesfield if you don't get this right away).
