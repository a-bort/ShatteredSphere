Flicker!

Let me get this straight. You fought, an EYE MONSTER? LIKE, A BEHOLDER?? Noooo wayy.
I think master Ketara would LOVE to pick your brain on that one!

Actually, since you left I have been working a LOT with master Ketara to figure out my pilgrimage of elemental mastery (I know I've mentioned it. I think I have.)
We've come up with a pretty cool plan I think.
You know how so many people are scared to tap into the weave of magic because it's unstable?
And we are taught to exercise our elemental powers only in situations of dire need?
Well, there have been stories of people who go into the Tropean Wastes and return with control over that chaos.
Ketara has been researching this and she thinks that there's something to these stories!
So I am planning to make my pilgrimage out there, the great storm the heart of the wastes.

Pilgrimages of elemental mastery are typically made alone, of course, which is pretty nerve wracking.
If I've picked up anything from you, though, I'm sure I will make friends along the way though.
Who knows, maybe we'll even run into each other!

But seriously, I'll be making my way along the major trade routes to Esteria, leaving in a few days time.
Write me at any Black Pearl along the way if you can!
I'll write you too.

All the best (and wish me luck),
Nuine
