 Hi Nunu, How are you? I hope everything is going well and that you ae enjoying monk food and life and happiness and zen and stuff. I’m fine. You said to write, so I am (and I’m not writing just because of an emergency! aren’t you proud)? I made some new friends! And I think they actually like me this time! YAY FRIENDS! There’s one called Alathea (who uses religion magic—I’ve never seen anything like it!), and she’s very pretty and nice. There’s a TORTLE name Tod, and his wife-shield (Sheila), he helps make sure we don’t starve. And there’s Lenny. He’s a human who makes magic stuff!!! I like him, he’s funny (he called me candle girl for a while, which was silly!). We just got done fighting some meanie zombies and now we’re going to explore into a cave. They’re all nice, I think you’d like them. Love you! Say hi to the masters and Brücke and Kyrka for me. I miss you all. BIG HEARTS, Faenor. (PS I won’t be where this letter came for very long (probably) so I don’t know if you should write. But I’m checking in like you promised. Please don’t tell mom I left—ok thank you!!!)
