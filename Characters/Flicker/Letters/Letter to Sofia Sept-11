Hi Sofia, I hope you and Kingston are doing well. Things here are the same as usual, learning and growing and stuff. I hope the Black Pearl is going well and that you are selling many chocolates. Please send some to NuNu, he always wants them (and he won’t ask). Anyway, I’m on an adventure and not with him…oopsies. Don’t tell Ontari. Love you! Give Kingston a hug for me. Faenor. (PS: But seriously, don’t tell Ontari. Ok thank you!!).
