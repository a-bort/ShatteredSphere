Dearest Faenor,

It is so lovely to hear from you! We are all doing very well, and business has been more than kind to us. So much so that even Kingston has found time to relax, and to enjoy his painting a bit more.
He had just mentioned you, in fact, and we both wondered how you might be finding your studies of late. I am not at all surprised to hear that you've decided to leave the monastery, and on and Adventure no less! How very exciting.
You are your own now woman, Faenor. I will not tell your Ontari, but you should practice honesty with her. Make good choices, and surround yourself with good people. All of my love,

Aunt Sofia

P.S. I've included a few surplus chocolates for you and your cousin both. Try not to eat it all at once!
