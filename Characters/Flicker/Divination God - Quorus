Name: Quorus
Domain: Divination
History:

One of the great wizards of the past, effectively a god.
Foresaw the Cataclysm and what it would do to the weave, and to the Material plane
Put the entirety of his magical capabilities into preserving the weave, specifically here in Dawnridge
Resulted in his transendence beyond the mortal realm
The weave here in Dawnridge flows through him
He knows all which occurs in his part of the weave.
His efforts are spent helping it heal, but that process has been impeded by the Risveld anti-magic area.
Knows the head guy in Risveld is a Lich, been around since pre-cataclysm days, who found a way to stabilize magic around an anchor
Nature of it is such that I cannot see into it. Has created his own localized weave?
The weave cannot be fully healed until this abberation is destroyed.
The mythallar you possess can stop it - but it needs to be activated close to this anchor.
Other mythallar's exist.
