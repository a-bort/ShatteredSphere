Male Cousin (Nunu), trainee at the Monastery of the Primordial Path

* Received a letter from Flicker

Nuine went to the monastery, and found solace in its teachings.
Physical appearance: Nuine looks like Lote, with auburn hair & purple eyes
Personality: Nuine is loving, and deeply believes in protecting those he loves…because he loves them. Nuine came with Lote to the monastery after Flicker was sent there, to meet his cousin. Determined to keep an eye on Flicker, he enrolled at the Order of the Primordial Path. Over time, he grew to love the Order, and is now dedicated to fully mastering its teachings.
Interactions with Flicker: Nuine didn’t know Flicker that well in Duskhearth, but was a deep confidant for Flicker at the monastery, and loves how different and special she is. Flicker LOVES Nuine with her whole heart, was delighted to have a family member at the monastery and calls him “Nunu.” She is the only one allowed to do this.
