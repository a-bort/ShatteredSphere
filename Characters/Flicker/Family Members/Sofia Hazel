Human, Cousin

Runs the Black Pearl trading co in Duskhearth.

Sofia is a loving business owner.
Physical appearance: Sofia looks like her father, with straight sandy hair and dark brown eyes.
Personality: Sofia loves to laugh and constantly marvels at the extended elven family she has. Warm and bubbly, she runs the Trading Post and makes sure everyone in Duskhearth has what they need. She’s not good at turning a profit, but very generous in hard times.
Interactions with Flicker: Sofia would make sure Flicker’s secret was hidden from the rest of town, and would always include extra sweets in packages for the Tamo Forge, so that Flicker was happy. She worries that Flicker was sent away on her own terms, but doesn’t know how to fix it.
