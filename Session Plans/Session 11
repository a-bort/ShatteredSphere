Things to clarify
* Tod sensed 40 humanoids spread out in a band, all approaching the city sort of radially inward
* Obviously also sensed hundreds of others behind him

Things to evoke in the opening scene
* Mist, snow, darkness overhead, lightning
** Visibility decreasing, down to 60 feet now
* Thundering footsteps approaching, louder giant footsteps as well
* Roar of the flying creature overhead
* Crumbling guard tower, guards thrown, injured.
* Shapes emerging from the mist!

Battle Notes
* Ask for Dex check for positioning while fleeing - minus Tod who can basically be where he wants
* Couple of injured / dead guards, branded emerging to fight
