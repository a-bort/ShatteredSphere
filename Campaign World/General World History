Old old empire - Antailian Empire - monotheistic empire, last one before the Revolution Arcanum
Revolution Arcanum basically killed the God of the monotheistic empire, and generally resulted in people stopping god worship
Most remaining gods left, their influence waning.
City states ruled by powerful mages, eventually went to war with each other over philosophical differences
Many of their cities built in what is now known as the Tropean Wastes
The big big war, many factions fighting one another, resulted in the world being rent - called the Cataclysm
Massive collapse of society for the most part, but not total armageddon thanks to Quorus containing the weave.

Rulers of the mageocracy went a step too far
Sought to attempt to seal their essences within massive gem stones, crafted to hold immense amounts of power
Like lichdom 2.0, sort of meant to give them a deific level of power
Went wrong, twisted the currents of magic as all gemstones of a certain quality for a moment were amplifying magic
Quorus held shit together, saw it coming
