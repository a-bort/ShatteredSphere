Old old empire - Antalian Empire - monotheistic empire, last one before the Revolution Arcanum
Revolution Arcanum basically killed the God of the monotheistic empire, and generally resulted in people stopping god worship
Most remaining gods left, their influence waning.
City states ruled by powerful mages, eventually went to war with each other over philosophical differences
Many of the floating cities built in what is now known as the Tropean Wastes, then an expansive jungle
A conspiration of 5 of these prime mages to gain a level of godhood went awry, resulting in a tear in the weave - called the Cataclysm
Massive collapse of society for the most part, but not total armageddon thanks to Quorus containing the broken weave,
Prevented the raw energies of the primordian chaos from being unleashed across the material plane.

Rulers of the mageocracy went a step too far
Sought to attempt to fuse their essences with massive gem stones loaded with unthinkable stores of arcane power
Like lichdom 2.0, sort of meant to give them a deific level of power
Went wrong, twisted the currents of magic and wrent a hole both in the weave and in reality, ruining the weave and unleashing a wave of primordial chaos across the land
Quorus held shit together, saw it coming

All magic was thrown into pure chaos in the aftermath of the weave being damaged beyond recognition
Even the most simple evocations of magic, standard at the time, would most often result in a wave of primordial elemental energy that would obliterate even the sturdiest of mages
Millions died in moments, as few knew what was unfolding, many people attempted magical means of protection in the initial blast and were killed outright

A few powerful mages and portents saw this event coming, and took measures to safeguard themselves and their realms
The Emperor Szun, leader of the Erdreich, with living in the beacon city of Veldstadt, invoked a great ritual to sever and preserve a portion of the weave around his central city
* Though the effects of the Cataclysm were felt in Veldstadt, and much destruction was wrought, tens of thousands of lives were saved
The Gith of the Whitereach cliffs overlooking the Malishear ocean invoked a similar rite, protecting their homeland and the cliffs
They knew thanks to the portents of Quorus the Stoic - who took the greatest measure of all (see Quorus)
