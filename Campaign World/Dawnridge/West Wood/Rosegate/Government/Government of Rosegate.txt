GOVERNMENT OF ROSEGATE

** Leaders follow bloodline but policies are kept in check by council elected by the people, with equal reps from duchies. 
** Bloodline can be swapped out, sometimes peacefully, sometimes not. 

* Current Leader / Lineage?
** Female/Dwarven - line of Dwarven Queens, highly regarded, great sense of pride in Rosegate and the western alliance
