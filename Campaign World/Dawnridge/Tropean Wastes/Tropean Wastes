Open badlands, ala Arizona Highlands

* More susceptible to magic surges. Each spell adds to a cumulative DC

* Has the Maelstrom in it
** Surrounded by a massive, complex winding chasm.
** Think grand canyon, and extending halfway through, towering swirling Maelstrom, flashes of elemental energy

* Outer Badlands
** More shrubby, with a proliferance of geysers and heat vents - relative greenery, no trees to speak of though
** Roving bands (goblins, orcs, gnolls, humanoids) of chaos warriors
*** Opportunistic but not dumb and not 100% hostile.
*** Ride giant boars, have wild magic sorcerers in their bands.
*** May misjudge the party and try to attack, but wouldn't fight long realizing their strength.
*** Will basically worship Flicker if/when they see her rage.
*** Some will join and help escort?
* Taurak Desert / Ruins - Ruins of floating cities
** Hobgoblin societies live within some of them
** Self sufficient Silver dragon-run enclave in one of them, with some rad functioning tech.
* There's a city in a below-ground chasm to the East.



* Esteria - city of mist
** Oasis in the Badlands
** Severian river empties into the Lake Esteria is this MASSIVE water fall
** Much of that water drifts into Esteria as mist
** A large lake sits beneath the falls, but the river does continue underground just beyond it
** Esteria is built in and around the great chasm that the continuation of the Severian river makes as it wends its way gradually underground
** Economy is based on subsistence living and farming (decent farming conditions around the lake)
** Not super green, but it's a kind of bastion in the wastes.
** Grow pretty good grapes - make dope wine.
** Also travelers who venture to the Taurak Ruins in search of fortune
** Lots of hardy common folk, rough types, adventurers, and also regular folk.
