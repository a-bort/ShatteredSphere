Towards the center of this plateau you find the Bonebreaker Clan Stronghold, a ring of natural stone walls and pillars, anywhere from 40 to 100 feet tall,which stretches several hundred yards across, and creates an oblong circle.
There is one large gap in this wall on the south side, but it has been filled by an intricate stonework wall, moss and vines covering portions, which looks several hundred years old.
Within, many intricately carved ziggurat-like buildings rise, crafted partially into the natural stone walls, while smaller stone buildings spread out at ground level.
At the far end of the circle there is a large open field of grass, with a large, beautifully carved building, almost a temple, serves as the backdrop.
