Three major factions

* East Hobgoblins - Bestial - Khalzol Fanatic Clan
** Control some goblins, orcs, humanoids

* Central Hobgoblins - Demonic - Dendak Hollow Clan
** Conrol some gnolls, tieflings

* City of Mist - Cult-like followers of a Mist Dragon
** All types of humanoids

* Survivalist tribes of Lizard-folk
** non-centralized
** speak only draconic

Environment
* Sandy and windy - minimal plant life. Occasional cactus or small shrub
** There are occasional oases and springs - this is where the Hobgoblin tribes have setup main encampments
* Maelstrom looms, dark with crackling lightning miles away
* Shadows of ruined cities, jutting out at odd angles
* Craggy stone outcroppings in place

Random POIs
* Ruined sky cities
* Enormous Skeleton
* Ruined temple - storing electrical energy in pylons still
* Hobgoblin encampments - usually around oases (water still bubbles up in spots)
* Scattered rubble with remains of petrified people

Howling Ravines
* Sit below the Maelstrom
* Populated primarily by demons - some other displaced creatures
* Wild Magic extremely amplified here - 2x DC for any spell cast
