Female Goliath, ~40s

Wise, thoughtful, but fierce.
Has a companion owlbear, with two cubs
Was competing with Za'alai for leadership of the tribe, lost out.
Still feels allegiance to the tribe, but despises the direction they have been taken
Goliaths are not meant to be subservient, and Zaâ€™alai, for all her strength, is a fool for following this Ossentia, powerful as she may be.
Spoke out against this arrangement, and was exiled by Za'alai.
Many of the tribe still view her favorably, and secretly agreed with her.
