Male Tabaxi, 40s

Black coat with copper markings. Rugged, a little thin, russian accent.
Lives out in the bitterwood typically, hunts game and brings back pelts etc. when he can to get a warm nights rest at the outpost.
Familiar with the Goliath tribes, has a few connections in each and generally just stays out of their way.
Happy to talk for a drink or some food.
