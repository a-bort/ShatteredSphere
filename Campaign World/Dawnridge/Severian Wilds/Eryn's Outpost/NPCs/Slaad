Green Slaad age ???

Has been lurking in the outpost for a short time (1 month?)
Slowly learning about the people, Infiltrating in the hopes of converting some to Panzuriel.
Was basically given the mission by chief slaad to take out the party.

Has a dark blue control gem
* High enough arcana check, can basically connect with the origin gem and see through it.
* Pulls vision across the wilds to the dark, partially sunken temple in the Leshen Wood.
* Zooming suddenly stops. Vision is refracted and stretched, as if peering through bent and imperfect glass.
* Can tell you're looking into a damp stone chamber lit by torches.
* The details are hazy, stone benches, raised stone altar.
* Can hear the sounds of dripping water, oddly distorted.
* See a creature moving in the shadows, just out of sight. Do you stay?
* Basically see a grey slaad lurking
