*White Wolf* aka the Druid of Frost Seat
* Human woman, only like 25 but looks way older. Original name was Corinne
* Her parents were living off the land in Frostford, outlaws from Redvale
** They died - mauled by an undead bear while hunting - she was with them, very traumatic
* Basically roughed it, found a dope place in the Frost Seat, with this large withered tree next to a pond w/ drinking water, etc
* Began discovering some control over nature - developed Druidic powers. Tree started to heal.
* Over time started dreaming of a figure, who spoke to her, showed her paths to more power
* Soon she began to hear this voice in her waking time. Became like a friend. Urged her to seek out powers
* It's basically a powerful Vampiric spirit in a Gulthias tree, awakened and nurtured by her proximity and belief
