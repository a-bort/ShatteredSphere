*White Wolf* aka the Druid of Frost Seat
* Human woman, only like 25 but looks way older. Original name was Corinne
* Her parents were living off the land in Frostford, outlaws from Redvale
** They died - mauled by an undead bear while hunting - she was with them, very traumatic
* Basically roughed it, discovered druidic powers (which she thinks she got from her mom)
* Joined with a pack of wolves and lived with them for a while
* Eventually found a dope place in the Frost Seat, with this large withered tree next to a pond w/ drinking water, etc
* In communicating with this tree, found a particularly strong presence within, much stronger than any other tree. Almost living.
* Her powers continued to grow as she spent time with the tree, and she learned her control over undead.
* Meanwhile the tree has become more healthy. Has drawn plant servants to it.

* It's basically a powerful Vampiric spirit in a Gulthias tree, awakened and nurtured by her proximity and belief
