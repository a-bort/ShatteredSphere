Open badlands, ala Arizona Highlands

* More susceptible to magic surges. Each spell adds to a cumulative DC

* Has the Maelstrom in it

* Taurak Desert / Ruins - Ruins of floating cities
** Hobgoblin societies live within some of them
* There's a city in a below-ground chasm.

* Eastoria - city of mist
** Oasis in the Badlands
** Severian river empties into the Lake Estoria is this MASSIVE water fall
** Much of that water drifts into Eastoria as mist
** A large lake sits beneath the falls, but the river does continue underground just beyond it
** Easteria is built in and around the great chasm that the continuation of the Severian river makes as it wends its way gradually underground
** Economy is based on subsistence living and farming (decent farming conditions around the lake)
** Not super green, but it's a kind of bastion in the wastes.
** Grow pretty good grapes - make dope wine.
** Also travelers who venture to the Taurak Ruins in search of fortune
** Lots of hardy common folk, rough types, adventurers, and also regular folk.
