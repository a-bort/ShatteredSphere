- Basically a Frontier Town
-- Original settlers were farmers, raised cattle and horses, also prospecting for gold/gems/other valuable minerals
-- Recent years as prospecting has died down (more money in mining up north) folks turning to Banditry.
-- Organized set of gangs have grown, beyond just regular dickery, also own large parts of the industry in town - mostly through coercion and worse.
- Tall, silvery purple wheat/grass
- Cattle, grain based economy, horses too
- Several inns, small theater, gambling hall
- Plenty of above-board
-- Trading companies pay an enormous amount to secure goods coming in and out of this town
- Several competing bands of outlaws, local sheriff is basically on all their payrolls

*OPEN THREADS*

- A platoon of the Risveld Army is stationed here, comprised of soldiers from Chesfield, Esteria, Ironside, and nearby lands - plus a few high ranking officers from the city.
-- Waiting for another platoon of soldiers from Goldencross to join up. Then marching... where?
-- In the meantime, trying to recruit bandits to their ranks.

- The Lyle Evans gang has resorted to extorting local temples, which is heavily looked down upon.
-- However, Red Jack has been preoccupied lately with the Risveld ... occupation of Chesfield.

- An elven monk had passed through a few days ago, staying at the Skylark Saloon
-- Picked up a guide there, ask / endear yourself to the right people to learn more about that guide
-- .. and learn he's a somewhat known member of a crime syndicate based out of Esteria.
--- Seek out wealthy suckers, rob them, or occasionally kidnap them and try to get a ransom.
