Moniker House
* Reasonably nice Tavern that specializes in cigars imported from the Copper Fields
* Imported Whiskeys as well, plus of course rice wine and ale
* The bartender/proprietor is ALWAYS smoking a cigar, and thus the place is perpetually filled with smoke

Shades Guild
* Do some standard robbing and stealing, usually low key
* Do some business in Chesfield with some of the gangs there
* Common ruse when they pick up wealthy travelers on the way to Esteria, acting as guides, and attempt to rob them on the road
* If unable to, will get them to stay at Moniker house, and then basically strong arm them into giving up their goods
* Occasionally will ransom them if it's worthwhile

Lost Sheep Tavern
* Dive bar in the bricks
* Info-thief operates out of here - goes by "Sylvan".
* Leave 3 SP on the table, tell the barkeep you're meeting a friend. Barkeep takes the silver, brings a stool
* Will require 100 GP for info on the location of the Brotherhood of the Elders
