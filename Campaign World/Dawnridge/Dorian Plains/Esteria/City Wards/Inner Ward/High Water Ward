Uber-nice, mansion portion of town.
Home to the ruling class, which are generally the wealthiest families
Also some extremely fancy shops and inns.
Must pass muster with the guards to get into the district in general.
Only residents and guests allowed within the subsection that houses the ruling class, occasionally open to the public.
Super clean and organized, sits above the mist and has never flooded
