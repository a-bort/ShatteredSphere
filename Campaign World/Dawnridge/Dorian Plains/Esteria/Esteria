v2

It is built atop a hill on the shore of lake Esteria.
The lake lies to the northwest of the city and spans ~4 miles across.
On the far side of the lake are Severian Falls - a MASSIVE waterfall originating some ~700 feet up, that carries virtually all of the water from the Severian Wilds into this lake.
The falls are the source of the near perpetual mist which fills the lower portion of the city and the region immediately surrounding the lake.
Just northeast of the city are the "cascades", a series of rocky shelves that gradually descend into the Cracked Riverlands.
Small waterways meander through the cascades, and the people of Esteria have converted much of it into productive rice farms.
To the south are marshlands, which quickly give way to the grasslands of the Dorian Plains.
The city itself is moderately large with a population of ~100,000.
An imposing stone wall surrounds the central city, carved from local sandstone in a style similar to what's seen in the Riverlands.
At a high level, there's the "inner city" within the wall, and "outer city" outside.
Inner is wealthier, outer is less so.
The inner city has a few main districts - the "High Water" district (where Nyx grew up) is home to the aristocracy as well as high-end businesses
The "Square" is a small district which contains all the city government buildings, guards barracks, etc.
The Trade and Entertainment district is easily the largest and busiest, and the East End and South End are the upper and middle class residential areas respectively.
The outer city has the Slums, the Arena, middle-lower class housing, a small docks, and then more industrial areas which deal in processing rice and other local goods for trade.

There are a number of small settlements and villages around the lake, and a few built into the cliffs on the far side.
These groups pay fealty and do plenty of business with and in Esteria.
Common trades include fishing and raising a species of rare sheep which climbs on the cliff sides and is prized for its soft wool.  

Much of the inner and outer city is very lush with plants and small trees, and people tend to hang strings of flags and other colorful items in the street, so visually it is very busy.
There are dim lanterns lit throughout the city 24/7 

There's a variety of architecture featured, though most buildings are stone and many resemble architecture from the Riverlands. 
There are a few "crime families" that operate throughout the city - some wealthier outfits which rub elbows with the aristocracy, and some poorer groups that are more or less your average group of thugs.
