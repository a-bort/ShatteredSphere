Panzuriel (Tempest / Darkness)

Ancient god, banished and influence relegated to the Plane of Water millenia ago

Book in the Temple
* Written in Deep Speech
- In the times before, the Old Gods removed Panzuriel's direct influence on the material plane
- Panzuriel's influence was relegated to the plane of water
- Over time the other gods lost their grasp and influence on the material plane as well, as their followings dwindled.
- All the whiel, Panzuriel maintained a shred of connection, sending creatures of the Deep to the material to occupy the uninhabited depths, which slowly kept his influence alive.
- In the great cataclysm, a massive rift was opened from the material to the plane of water, in the Malishear Ocean, to the North East of Dawnridge
- Panzuriel used this opportunity to sent his Chosen to the material, leading an army of creatures from the Deep to invade Dawnridge.
- The high elves of Whitereach Cliffs beat the invading forces back for centuries, and eventually managed to seal his Chosen back into the plane of water.
- After this defeat, Panzuriel sought other ways to gain influence on the material
- During the cataclysm, the underdark was severed from the material plane, and so Panzuriel used his influence to flood the space below
- He now spreads his tendrils throughout Dawnridge, sending his agents to sow chaos, and weaken the realms above to allow his Chosen to claim the continent.

Journal in the Temple
* Written in Deep Speech
- Takes a while to make heads or tails of it
- Seems to be a stream of consciousness output of dreams
- All the standard talk - "the grasping darknses" - "all must return" - "Panzuriel's chosen will rise"
- "Go to the Town of Iron" - "Send the vessel to sew seeds, implant visions" - "Kindly Turtle will do our work"
- "Interfering humanoids" - "New mission, remove the problem"
- "Pursue. They travel north." - "Cannot travel far into the freezing tundra" - "Wait them out. The outpost."
