Panzuriel (Tempest / Darkness)

Ancient god, banished and influence relegated to the Plane of Water millenia ago

Book in the Temple
* Written in Deep Speech
- In the times before, the Old Gods removed Panzuriel's direct influence on the material plane
- Panzuriel's influence was relegated to the plane of water
- Over time the other gods lost their grasp and influence on the material plane as well, as their followings dwindled.
- All the while, Panzuriel maintained a shred of connection, sending creatures of the Deep to the material to occupy the depths, which  kept his influence alive.
- In the great cataclysm, a massive rift was opened from the material to the plane of water, in the Malishear Ocean
- Panzuriel used this opportunity to sent his Chosen to the material, leading an army of creatures from the Deep to invade Dawnridge.
- The high elves of Whitereach Cliffs beat the invading forces back for centuries, and eventually managed to seal his Chosen back into the plane of water.
- After this defeat, Panzuriel has sought other ways to gain influence on the material
- During the cataclysm, the underdark was severed from the material plane, and so Panzuriel used his influence to flood the space below
- He now spreads his tendrils throughout the overworld, sending his agents to sow chaos, and weakening the realms so that one day his Chosen will rise to claim the continent for the God of the Depths.

Journal in the Temple
* Written in Deep Speech
- Takes a while to make heads or tails of it
- Seems to be a stream of consciousness output of dreams
- All the standard talk - "the grasping darknses" - "all must return" - "Panzuriel's chosen will rise"
- "Go to the Town of Iron" - "Send the vessel to sew seeds, implant visions" - "Kindly Turtle will do our work"
- "Interfering humanoids" - "New mission, remove the problem"
- "Pursue. They travel north." - "Cannot travel far into the freezing tundra" - "Wait them out. The outpost."
