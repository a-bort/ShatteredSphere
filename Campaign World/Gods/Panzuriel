Book in the Temple
* Written in Deep Speech
- In the times before, the Old Gods removed Panzuriel's direct influence on the material plane
- Panzuriel's influence was relegated to the plane of water
- Over time the other gods lost their grasp and influence on the material plane as well, as their followings dwindled.
- Meanwhile Panzuriel managed to maintain a shred of connection, sending creatures of the Deep to the material to seize control and spread his influence
- In the great cataclysm, a massive rift was opened from the material to the plane of water, in the Temishear Ocean, to the North East of Dawnridge
- Panzuriel seized the opportunity, and sent his Chosen to the material, leading an army of creatures from the Deep to invade Dawnridge.
- The high elves of Whitereach Cliffs beat the invading forces back for centuries.
- Gaining no ground, and his Chosen banished back to the plane of water, Panzuriel sought other ways to gain influence on the material
- During the cataclysm, the underdark was severed from the material plane, and so Panzuriel used his influence to flood the space below
- He now spreads his tendrils throughout Dawnridge, sending his agents to sow chaos, and weaken the realms above to allow his Chosen to claim the continent.
