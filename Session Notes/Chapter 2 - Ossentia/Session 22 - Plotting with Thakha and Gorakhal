* Arrive at Eryn's outpost after traveling the day in a whiteout blizzard
* A few half orcs in the bar, one talking to Eryn
* Pay for a nights stay, get food.
* Message to Thakha, she tells em "Iâ€˜m confirmed as leader. Ossentia loyalists fled north last night. Contacted Agataire about an alliance. Join us and we can plan together.
* Message to Fay, she's back. Town's getting more back to normal. Things being fixed. Word getting around that they're taking care of business.
* Chat with Winter Winds - don't glean much new. Give him an ice manticore feather.
* Lenny attempts to reverse engineer the gem of slaad control. Rolls a 19 - and sets up a good foundation of understanding the enchantment, how it functions
* Next AM - Shop! Buy dust of Dryness and a bowl. Sell manticore feathers for 8 sp apiece (was gonna be 5, good negotiation by Flicker).
** Alatheia gets a hat to help affix the leshen skull
** Notice the nice pelt that Winter Winds brought in
** Alatheia buys healers kit.
* Travel through light snow, get to edge of settlement a bit before by nightfall.
* Meet guards on the edge of the settlement, are up front, and they are lead into talk with Thakha and Gorakhal.
** Plot plot plot. Gorakhal reveals a lot about the mindset and predicts that Ossentia will send giants to deal with us, and gather her faithful close to her.
** Thakha suggests that while the force heads this way, they go surprise Ossentia. Party not so sure, wants to help defend here.
** Consider allying with the Otandor against the Doliman, help them take that land. Party eventually decides that's a dick move
** Consider just staying around, fortifying the settlement.
** Decide to go on the aggressive, attack the NW pass and take it from the Otandor, and defend from the Giants there at the choke point
* To confirm the assumptions, Alatheia casts:
** Commune (+5) - Is Ossentia sending force to attack here? - YES | Will attack arrive within 3 days? - YES | Will attack strike in next day? - NO
** Augury (+4) - How will Otandor respond to Galaban proposal of alliance? - The will agree if you do the work
** DC = 23
* Alatheia heals 2 in the village - one child who has some kind of disease, and one older person who has a broken leg.
* Overnight, Alatheia rolls a "06" and is taken over.
** Goes to stab Lenny, but Lenny notices in time
** Lenny tries to talk her out of it, doesn't work.
** Eventually Tod wakes up and Grapples her. Also wakes Flicker
** Flicker grabs the dagger and they tie her up.
** She writhes through the night, they sleep in and everyone gets a long rest except Alatheia, who comes to the next dawn.
** DC = 18 -- and Alatheia learns of the DC
* Next AM, Alatheia casts:
** Commune (+5) - Will they use the NW pass? - Y | Does the force include hill giants? - Y | Does it include Kensenee? - N
** DC = 23 - Alatheia feels the connection grow stronger
* Put it in the bag of holding
** DC = 21
* Overcast with flurries
* Planning to bring a scout to lead them to it.
