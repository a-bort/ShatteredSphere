* Sending to Thakha - Thakha tells them all good, small skirmish at the pass but nothing too bad
* Sending to Lief - tells him there's a letter to him at Ironside
* Wake in the morning, light snow

* Fight commences
** The assassins take the watch, fire a flare
** The infiltrators go into the Kensenee homestead area and start the fires
** Galaban homies go into the Doliman settlement, do well, but fall in battle

* Agataire strike down the Giant druid from the west, and we end there
