** Party spends too long debating, and the creature notices them
** They do hear voices off in the distance of the cavern
** Good use of spirit guardians by Alatheia
** Flicker is blinding guys and doing pretty good work
** Nyx bamfs in the darkness and wreaks havoc
* At the end of the fight, Flicker hears Nuine calling from the back cavern
* Alatheia dives down into the pit and destroys the big baddie
* They rush back to the cave and find Nuine plus the half-human half-deep scion creature
* Rescue Nuine, tearful reunion
* Discover Nuine is not doing well, looks awful, probably the same thing that the half-scion has going on
* Attempt to lesser restoration, which doesn't work
* Pacify the half-scion, take them with
* Decide to head back via boat, navigate the passage and find it
* 45 minutes later they are back at the hut and take a long rest there
* Next AM, Alatheia casts remove curse on Nuine and the guy, whose name is Brannon
* He looks a bit better, but not much - eyes look human but growths on the head and slightly elongated, webbed fingers, sharp teeth
* Head back into town, end of session!
