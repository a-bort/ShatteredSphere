Start out in Moniker house, facing the half orc, who calls out their Boss
Alatheia casts command on two of them - but the Orc succeeds and it's initiative
Fight goes on for a little bit, but Nyx attempts to talk
The boss guy sees at this point that they mean business, and decides to chat
Basically blames the whole thing on Lionel, the Teifling who captured Nuine
The party convinces Galifax to let them "have" Lionel, and he agrees
They go to Nyx's favorite Ital-ian restaurant for a short rest - have a long chat
Eventually they head to Far Zenith, where they find the fishing shack
Nyx teleports in super stealthy, sees a sleeping guard
Her and Lionel assassinate the guard real quick
They head down the ladder and don't see the other guard, who flees, and manages to send a message ahead
They find the branching hallway with an illusion masking the other branch and follow
Make their way into the flooded room, traverse carefully, make some noise
Go the wrong branch, back track, and then Lionel gets attacked by a Chuul.
Fight is stressful at first but Alatheia casts control water and basically owns the whole thing
They end by seeing the big ass Abberation in the middle of the next chamber.
