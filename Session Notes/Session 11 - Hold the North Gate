Fight the Waves of Goliaths!

* Flicker sprints into the fog, gets a sick necro blast off (super buffed)
* Tod takes a few on, goes down a few times
* Alathea uses her spiritual weapon to great success
* Lenny hangs back and uses his blaster turret - eventually gets cornered by a storm herald
* Flicker climbs on the back of a giant, goes toe to toe
* The humans put up a good fight but the day belongs to the giants
* One guard sends his zombie out, who actually does a little damage
* That guard eventually goes down
* They see Za'alai flying overhead, buffing allies
* Hear her warning, and the goliaths retreat
* They see the Druid through the fog, Flicker sprints at her
* The ice manticore gets 3 shots into flicker and she goes down
